# RecentTab
**RecentTab** is a Chrome extension designed to help you efficiently cycle through your most recently used tabs. Improve your browsing experience by quickly navigating between recently accessed tabs using customizable keyboard shortcuts.

## Commands

- **`Alt + W | Option + W`**: Quickly switch to the last tab when pressed once. Press multiple times in quick succession to switch to the nth most recently used tab.
- **`Alt + Q | Option + Q`**: Backtrack through the list of recently used tabs. 
- **`Alt+Shift+Q | Option+Shift+Q`**: Move forward through the most recently used tabs list.

## Features

- **`Shortcuts`**: All command shortcuts can be customized to your liking.
- **`New Tabs`**: When you open a new link without immediately accessing it, that link will automatically be added to the top of the Most Recently Used Tab list. This feature resolves the problem of opening new links from within a page and not being able to access it without manually clicking the tab.

## Installation

1. **Download** or clone the extension source code from the repository.
2. **Open Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. **Enable Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
4. **Click "Load unpacked"** and select the extension's directory where you downloaded or cloned the source code.

## Recommendations

1. **Optimize with Mouse Shortcuts**: If your mouse has customizable buttons, consider mapping one of them to the quick tab switch command (`Alt + W`). This setup allows you to switch tabs efficiently without having to use the keyboard, I've personally been using this for years now.

2. **Provide Feedback**: Your feedback is valuable! If you have suggestions or encounter issues, please report them via the GitHub Issues page. Your input helps improve the extension for everyone.
