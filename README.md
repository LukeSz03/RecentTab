# RecentTab
**RecentTab** is a Chrome extension designed to help you efficiently cycle through your most recently used tabs. Improve your browsing experience by quickly navigating between recently accessed tabs using customizable keyboard shortcuts.

## Features

- **`Alt + W`**: Quickly switch to the last tab when pressed once. Press multiple times in quick succession to switch to the nth most recently used tab.
- **`Alt + Q`**: Backtrack through the list of recently used tabs. (not implemented)
- **`Alt + E`**: Move forward through the most recently used tabs list. (not implemented)
- Keyboard  shortcuts customizable in Chrome's extension settings

## Installation

1. **Download** or clone the extension source code from the repository.
2. **Open Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. **Enable Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
4. **Click "Load unpacked"** and select the extension's directory where you downloaded or cloned the source code.

## Recommendations

1. **Optimize with Mouse Shortcuts**: If your mouse has customizable buttons, consider mapping one of them to the quick tab switch command (`Alt + W`). This setup allows you to switch tabs efficiently without having to use the keyboard, I've personally been using this for years now.

2. **Provide Feedback**: Your feedback is valuable! If you have suggestions or encounter issues, please report them via the GitHub Issues page. Your input helps improve the extension for everyone.
